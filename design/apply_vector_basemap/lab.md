###Vector Basemaps

Esri has introduced a new set of [vector basemaps](http://www.arcgis.com/home/search.html?q=owner:esri_vector) now in beta release. There are several benefits to vector basemaps including high-res displays, smaller and easier to update and the ability to customize the look and feel of the basemaps. You can see them live [here](http://www.arcgis.com/home/search.html?q=owner:esri_vector).

In this lab you will swap your basemap with a your favorite vector basemap.

###Steps

1. Go to [arcgis.com](http://www.arcgis.com) and login.

2. Click on [this link](http://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=6dd14f639f784ff692327d8f4b3eb00a) to load a map. Or use your own map.

3. Click `Add` to add a vector tile > `Search for Layers` > `In: ArcGIS Online`.

	1. Search for:

		```
		owner:esri_vector -mature
		```
		
	2. Click on `World Street Map (Night)` (DO NOT CLICK ADD!) > ```Add to Map```.

	3. Click `Done Adding Layers`.
 
4. Save your map.

Your map should look something like [this map](http://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=11e2285a131540f792c58565db996b4b)
