### Vector Basemaps

Esri has introduced vector basemaps. There are several benefits to vector basemaps including the ability to customize the map to change its content and symbology, including fonts.  You can also turn on and off layers, change symbols for layers and switch to alternate local language in some areas. You can see them live [here](http://www.arcgis.com/home/search.html?q=owner:esri%20type:tile%20layer).

In this lab you will swap an existing basemap with your favorite vector basemap.

### Steps

1. Go to [arcgis.com](http://www.arcgis.com) and login.

2. Click on [this link](http://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=6dd14f639f784ff692327d8f4b3eb00a) to load a map. Or use your own map.

3. Click `Add` to add a vector tile > `Search for Layers` > `In: ArcGIS Online`.

	1. Search for:

		```
		owner:esri type:tile layer
		```
		
	2. Click on `World Street Map (Night)` > ```Add```.

	3. Click `Done Adding Layers`.

4. Click on the three dots ". . . " under the checkbox for `World Street Map (Night)` to show the option list > `Move to Basemap`

5. Save your map.

Your map should look something like [this map](http://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=11e2285a131540f792c58565db996b4b)
