### Create a new map

The easiet way to create a new map is to use the [Map Viewer](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/use-maps/view-maps.htm).

In this lab you will create a new map from existing layers that have been already been published.

### Steps

1. Go to [arcgis.com](http://www.arcgis.com) and login.  

2. Click `MAP`.

3. Click `Add` > `Search for Layers` > `In: ArcGIS Online`.

	1. Search for:

		```
		PDX_Rail_Stops (by al_geodev)
		PDX_Rail_Lines (by al_geodev)
		PDX_Neighborhoods_Enriched (by al_geodev)
		```

		NOTE: Do not select the `xxx_Styled` layers.

	2. Click `Add` to add each layer to the map.

	3. Click `Done Adding Layers`.
 
4. Drag to reorder the layers so that `PDX Rail Stops` is on top, `PDX Rail Lines` is next and `PDX Neighborhoods Enriched` is on the bottom.

5. Choose the `Light Gray` basemap.

6. Explore the default data by clicking on the map.

7. Save your map. 

	NOTE: With the default styles, your map should look something like [this map](http://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=c8cd4b6f2d724c99be9a2d14fb31603e).

8. Go to `My Contents` to view the item for this map.

### Bonus

* View the JSON for the web map by using the REST API to access the item in your account. In your web browser, paste in this url. Try formatting the JSON with [this JSON Editor tool](http://www.jsoneditoronline.org/).
