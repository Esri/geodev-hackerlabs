###Create an application using a Configurable Template

You can use any of the [Configurable App Templates](http://www.arcgis.com/home/gallery.html#c=esri&t=apps&o=modified&f=configurable) to build differnt types of focused HTML, CSS, JS apps. All apps are developed on top of an existing web map and are shared out as a web application. By default, these apps are stored and hosted in ArcGIS Online, but you can also download all of the code locally and host and customize them yourself.

In this lab, you will build a simple Template app.

1. Click [this map](http://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=7186a92406194797aa518c06c189a71f) to open the map in the Map Viewer. If you have your own map, you can try to use that too.

2. Click `Share` > `Create a Web App` > `Configurable Apps`.

3. Search for the `Public Information` template and select `Create App`.

4. set the following properties:

 ```
 Title: 2015 Portland Population Density
 Tags: Portland, Map, Population, Density,Template App
 Summary: Portland population map built with the Public Information Template
 ```

 Click `Done` to launch the configuration page.

4. Change the following properties:

 ```
 Choose Swipe Layer: Population Density
 Details: 
  Application Title: 2015 Portland Population Density
  Application Summary: 2015 Portland Population Density
 Configuration Options:

 ```

 Click `Save and View` > `Close`.

6. Click `Open` > `View Application` to test-drive your app.

Your app should look something like [this](http://edn.maps.arcgis.com/apps/PublicInformation/index.html?appid=09ed800aca42450c89278c3c6a3815dc).

###Bonus

* View the JSON for the web app by using the REST API to access the item in your account. Try formatting the JSON with try [this JSON Editor tool](http://www.jsoneditoronline.org/).
