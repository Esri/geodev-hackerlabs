###Search with Widget

In this lab you will add a search widget and search against a feature layer. The widget performs context-sensitve search as you type and then it will zoom to and highlight the feature selected. You can also format the data in the popup that appears. 

In this lab it will search against the neighborhood polygon layer but you can point to any hosted feature layer you want.

1. Click [create_starter_map/index.html](../create_starter_map/index.html) and copy the contents to a new [jsbin.com](http://jsbin.com).

2. In `JSBin` > `HTML`, update the `require` statement and function definition:

    ```javascript
    require([
      "esri/Map",
      "esri/views/MapView",
      "esri/widgets/Search",
      "esri/layers/FeatureLayer",
      "dojo/domReady!"
    ], function(Map, MapView, Search, FeatureLayer) {
      ... 
    ```

3. Create the Search widget and add it to the `top-right` of the UI.

    ```javascript
    ], function(Map, MapView, Search, FeatureLayer) {

      var map = new Map({
        basemap: "dark-gray"
      });

      var view = new MapView({
        container: "viewDiv",
        map: map,
        center: [-122.68, 45.52], // lon, lat
        zoom: 10
      });

      var searchWidget = new Search({
        view: view,
        allPlaceholder: "Neighborhood e.g. Downtown"
      });

      searchWidget.startup();

      view.ui.add(searchWidget, {
        position: "top-right"
      });
    ```

    At this point, the map will allow you to search against the default ArcGIS Online Geocoding Service. Give it a go. You can enter an address or point of interest (like `Providence Park` or `PDX`) or a geography (like `Oregon` or `USA`).

4. Now add the Neighborhoods Feature Service as a search source to the widget. This will allow you to search for different neighborhoods by the `Name` field. Also notice that a template is added for the popup to format the data nicely.

    ```javascript
      var searchWidget = new Search({
        view: view,
        allPlaceholder: "Neighborhood e.g. Downtown"
      });

      // ADD sources here...
      var sources = [];
      
      sources.push({
        featureLayer: new FeatureLayer("http://services.arcgis.com/uCXeTVveQzP4IIcx/arcgis/rest/services/PDX_Neighborhoods_Styled/FeatureServer/0"),
        name: "Neighborhood Search",
        searchFields: ["NAME"],
        displayField: "NAME",
        exactMatch: false,
        outFields: ["NAME","AVGHINC_CY","MEDAGE_CY","TOTPOP_CY"],
        placeholder: "Neighborhood e.g. Downtown",
        // Create a PopupTemplate to format data
        popupTemplate: {
          title: "{NAME}",
          content: "Median Age: {MEDAGE_CY}</br>Average Household Income: {AVGHINC_CY}</br> Population: {TOTPOP_CY}"
        }
      });

      searchWidget.sources = sources;
    ```

5. In JSBin, run the app and type in `Downtown` or `St. John's`. The app should highlight and zoom into the neighborhood polygon, and a popup should also be displayed with there field data.

Your app should look something like this:
* [Code](index.html)
* [Live App](http://esri.github.io/geodev-hackerlabs/develop/jsapi/search_with_widget/index.html)

###Bonus
* Add the default world geocoder to the search widget as well.
* Add a [Rail Stops feature layer](http://services.arcgis.com/uCXeTVveQzP4IIcx/arcgis/rest/services/PDX_Rail_Stops_Styled/FeatureServer/0) to the Search widget.
