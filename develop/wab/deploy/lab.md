### Deploy your Web AppBuilder project to ArcGIS Online

Now that you have a customized Web AppBuilder application running on your own web server, we can make it available for other webmap authors in our Organization to take advantage of as well.

In this exercise, you will:
* **Register your local application as an ArcGIS Online Item**
* **Create a new group to share the item**
* **Ensure that ArcGIS Online is using content from this group when displaying templates**

1. On the Web AppBuilder homepage [http://[server]:3344/webappbuilder/](http://[server]:3344/webappbuilder/), click `Edit` for the application you would like to export as template.

2. In the `Theme` tab click the `^` to the right of the Saved button > `Export As Template` and select the individual options you want to make configurable for webmap authors later and then click `Export` > `Export to My Organization`.
