###Create a Web AppBuilder Application

You can use the [Web AppBuilder for ArcGIS](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/web-appbuilder/) to build an HTML, CSS, JS app that will run on any device. All apps are developed on top of an existing web map and are shared out as a web application.

In this lab, you will build a simple WAB app.

1. Click [this map](http://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=27970d32436a446dabb3c71cf949115e) to open the map in the Map Viewer. If you have your own map, you can try to use that too.

2. Click `Share` > `Make a Web Application` > `Web App Builder`.

3. Set the following properties:

 ```
 Title: Portland Neighborhoods WAB App
 Tags: Portland, Map, WAB App
 Description: Portland neighborhood map built with the Web App Builder
 ```

 Click `Get Started`

4. In `Themes` and set the `Style` > `Black`.

5. Click `Widget`

 * Add the `My Location` widget.
 * Change the placeholder text in the `Geocoder` widget to `"Explore Porland"`.

6. Click `Attribute` and change the subtitle to `Where do we live?`.

7. Click `Save`.

8. Click `Launch` to test the application.

###Bonus
* Click `Previews` to test the app at different screen sizes.
* Scan the QR code to view the app on your mobile device.
* Try adding and configuring different themes and widgets.
