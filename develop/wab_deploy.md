### Deploy your Web AppBuilder project to ArcGIS Online

Now that you have a customized Web AppBuilder application running on your own web server, we can make it available for other webmap authors in our Organization to take advantage of as well.

In this exercise, you will:
* **Register your local application as an ArcGIS Online ‘Item’**
* **Create a new group to share the item with**
* **Ensure that ArcGIS Online is using content from this group when displaying templates**

1. On the Web AppBuilder homepage [http://[server]:3344/webappbuilder/](http://[server]:3344/webappbuilder/), click the three dots on the righthand side of the custom application you’d like to share and choose `Export as Template`

2. In the next dialog, use the `+` to select individual options you want to make configurable for webmap authors later and then click `Export`

3. Give the template a name, tags, description and save it in your folder of choice

4. Choose `click here` to see the item details page for your new template and use the ‘share’ button to share with an appropriate group.
  * If you have not yet configured ArcGIS Online to surface custom templates to webmap authors it will be necessary to follow the steps below.

5. Click `Groups` (in the top lefthand corner of most ArcGIS Online pages) and choose `Create a Group`.  Fill in the appropriate details and share the Group within your organization.

6. In the `Map` tab of the Organization’s settings (available to administrators from Home > Edit Settings), choose this new group from the dropdown.

7. Afterwards, share your new template with this group.  (This would also be a good opportunity to confirm that it appears to webmap authors as a configurable template when they share their own maps).


### Extras
 * Use your new custom template to share a new webmap in ArcGIS Online.
