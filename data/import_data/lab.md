###Import Data

ArcGIS Online allows you to import [a wide variety of data types](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/share-maps/supported-items.htm) into the cloud. Each dataset is added as [hosted web layer](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/share-maps/hosted-web-layers.htm) that can be accessed later by apps and APIs.

In this lab you will use [Add items](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/share-maps/add-items.htm) to import data into your account.

###Steps

1. [Download](pdx_data.zip?raw=true) and unzip the data.

2. Go to [arcgis.com](http://www.arcgis.com) and login.

3. Click `My Content` > `Add Items` to import each dataset into your account. Make sure the box is checked that publishes each dataset as a feature service. It is optional but try to group the datasets in folders.  e.g.

 ```
 * PDX_Neighborhoods.zip
 * PDX_Rail_Lines.geojson
 * PDX_Rail_Stops.csv
 ```

4. View each dataset and make sure it has proper tags, description and attribution.  Edit if necessary.

###Bonus
* Try importing some of your own data.

> note: ArcGIS Online supports a [*wide variety*](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/reference/supported-items.htm) of file uploads, but only a select few can be used to publish [hosted feature services](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/share-maps/publish-features.htm)

* Explore the `Overview` and `Settings` tabs to control your layer. Explore the Share and Edit capabilities of each layer.
* Explore the `Data`, `Visualization` and `Usage` tabs.
