###Share Data

You can use ArcGIS Online to control who can view your data items. Items can be [shared](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/share-maps/share-items.htm) with groups, organizations or just kept private for you to view.

In this lab you will explore how to share layers.

NOTE: If you don't have any data items in your account, go to [Import Data](./import_data.md) first.

###Steps

1. Go to [arcgis.com](http://www.arcgis.com) and login. Check `Keep me signed in`.

2. Click `My Content`.

3. In `My Content`, select one of your Feature Layers (data items).

4. Select `Share` and explore the sharing options then share your data.

###Bonus
* You can also share items to groups. Use ArcGIS Online to search for groups that have shared items.
