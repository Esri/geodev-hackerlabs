###Create and Edit Data

[ArcGIS for Developers](http://developers.arcgis.com) allows you to interactively create and publish hosted web services (feature services) to the cloud. All you need to do is specify the feature service name and fields (schema) and then save it. After it's created you can add data interactively with the [Map Viewer](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/use-maps/view-maps.htm) or with other ArcGIS apps e.g. ArcGIS Collector or via custom apps.  

In this lab you will create a new point feature service and add data to it.

###Steps

1. Go to [developers.arcgis.com](http://developers.arcgis.com) and login.  

2. Go to `Layers` and then click `Create New Layer` to create a new dataset. 

 Specify the following:

 ```
 Title: PDX Points
 Tags: Portland
 Description: PDX Points
 Geometry: points
 ```

3. Under `Fields`, `Add` the following fields:
  
 ```
 Name (String)
 Type (String)
 Date (Date)
 ```

 NOTE: You can create as many fields you want.

4. Click `Create Layer`.

5. Click `Open in Map Viewer`. This should load the layer into the ArcGIS Online Map Viewer.

6. Zoom to Portland, Oregon, USA.

7. Click `Edit` then select `New Feature` then hover your mouse over the map. Click on the map to add some points to the feature layer dataset. Make sure you add field values to the popup window.

###Bonus 
* Explore editing by moving some points and updating the field data.
