###View in a Map

One of the easiest ways to explore a feature layer (feature service) is to use the [Map Viewer](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/use-maps/view-maps.htm). You can view your own layers or search for existing layers in ArcGIS Online.

In this lab you will add your own layers and some existing publicly available layers into a map.

###Steps

1. Go to [arcgis.com](http://www.arcgis.com) and login.  

2. Click `My Content`.

3. Click on a `feature layer` > `Open` > `Add layer to new map`.

 NOTE: If you don't have any layers in your account, go to [Import Data](../import_data/lab.md) first.

4. Explore the data interactively by clicking on the features.

5. Click `Details` > `layer` > `Show Table` and explore the data.

6. Save your map. 

###Bonus
* In the Map Viewer select `Add` > `Search for Layers` > `In: ArcGIS Online` to load other pre-existing layers into your map. HINT: Try searching for weather, rain or wind. You might try changing `In: My Organization` to `In: ArcGIS Online` to see more layers.
